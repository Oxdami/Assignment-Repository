2. *Auto Scaling*: AWS provides advanced auto-scaling capabilities, allowing you to scale your resources up or down automatically based on demand. DigitalOcean also offers auto-scaling, but it's not as robust as AWS.

SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE

1. *Compliance Certifications*: AWS has a broader range of compliance certifications, including HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and GDPR, making it a more attractive choice for regulated industries. DigitalOcean also offers some compliance certifications, but not as many as AWS.
